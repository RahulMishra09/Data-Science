## NumPy Notes

This repository contains notes and resources related to NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

### About NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific research.
